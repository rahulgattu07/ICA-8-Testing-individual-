# ICA-8-Testing-individual-

This is a private repository specific to 515 course created regarding the assignment ICA 8 Testing.

I implemented the following features in the project:
1) It uses junit testing to implement and test the good string function.
2) It incorporates the "getÂ urinals" method and does junit testing during testing phase.
3) It provides the user with the opportunity to choose whether input is obtained from the file or the console, and the project is implemented in accordance with that choice.
